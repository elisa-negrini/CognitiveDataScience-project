# Zipfian Patterns in LLM-Generated Text

This repository contains the code, data, and resources used in the project "Zipfian Patterns in LLM-Generated Text: A Quantitative Analysis" by Elisa Negrini (2025). The study investigates whether Zipfâ€™s law persists in synthetic text generated by large language models (LLMs), under different prompts and sampling temperatures.
